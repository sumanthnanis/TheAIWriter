Empowering Rural Artisans: A Mobile Application for Selling Handcrafted Products and Community Engagement

Abstract

Many individuals in rural areas possess skills for crafting products but lack platforms to effectively sell their goods, especially those who are unskilled or unfamiliar with complex mobile applications. In response to this challenge, representatives from Self-Help Groups (SHGs) have visited numerous villages, imparting skills to residents for crafting various products. Subsequently, a mobile application named "VCOM" was developed to enable individuals to sell their products online without intermediary charges, ensuring maximum returns. VCOM also enriches the user experience by providing insights into the product's origin and the story of the village where it was crafted, fostering a sense of connection and community engagement. The software system design focuses on creating a suitable UI and screen flow to support the registration of users, especially those new to using mobile applications. Additionally, the high-level architecture of the mobile application is inspired by existing work, utilizing Flutter, Dart, Node.js, and MySQL to provide a user-friendly interface tailored for ease of use by individuals with varying levels of education.

UI and Screen Flow Design

The user interface and screen flow design for the VCOM mobile application are crucial to ensuring a seamless user experience, particularly for individuals who may be unfamiliar with complex mobile applications. The focus of this design is to support the registration process for users, taking into consideration the varying levels of familiarity with technology. A linear application workflow is employed to guide users through the registration process, with visual elements such as universally recognizable icons used to enhance user interaction. This approach aims to make the interface text-free and intuitive, catering to individuals with varying levels of education and technological proficiency. 

Software Architecture

The high-level architecture of the VCOM mobile application draws inspiration from existing work, encompassing both client-side and server-side components. On the client-side, the architecture comprises the user interface and application logic, with individual views managed by the Screen and interactions with providers handling data and services. The client-side also generates API calls to the external Server. On the server-side, the architecture includes a Server component responsible for handling client requests through defined Routes, directing them to specific functions, and interacting with the Database to manage data. This architectural design is aimed at ensuring efficient operations and interactions between the client and server, ultimately contributing to a smooth user experience.

Software Technologies

The VCOM mobile application leverages specific software technologies to achieve its objectives. Flutter was chosen for its ability to develop visually appealing cross-platform applications efficiently, catering to the diverse user base of the application. Dart, as the language for both frontend and backend development, provides versatility and accessibility. In addition, Node.js was selected for its scalability and efficiency in handling various operations, such as serving HTTP requests and managing databases. The utilization of a MySQL structured database further ensures data integrity and facilitates cost-effective visualizations through table-based representations. Together, these technologies enable the development of a user-friendly interface tailored for individuals with varying levels of education and technical proficiency.

Background

Individuals in rural areas often possess valuable crafting skills but face challenges in effectively selling their products due to a lack of suitable platforms, especially for those who are unskilled or unfamiliar with complex mobile applications. In response to this problem, representatives from Self-Help Groups (SHGs) have been visiting numerous villages, imparting crafting skills to residents. This has led to the development of a mobile application named "VCOM," which aims to provide a platform for individuals to sell their products online without intermediary charges, ensuring maximum returns. In addition to facilitating sales, the VCOM platform enriches the user experience by providing insights into the product's origin and the story of the village where it was crafted, fostering a sense of connection and community engagement. The primary focus of this research paper is to design and develop a user-friendly mobile application that enables individuals with varying levels of education and experience to effectively use the platform for selling their crafted products.

Significance of the Problem 

The significance of the problem outlined in the research paper lies in addressing the economic challenges faced by individuals in rural areas who possess valuable crafting skills but lack effective platforms to sell their goods.
