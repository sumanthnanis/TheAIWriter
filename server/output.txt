The development of e-commerce mobile applications has become increasingly important in
providing a platform for selling products, especially for Self Help Groups
(SHGs) trained to create unique products. This research paper explores the
use of Flutter, Dart, Node.js, and MySQL as the key technologies
in the development of an e-commerce mobile application for SHGs. These
technologies offer efficient cross-platform development, clean and maintainable code, scalability, and
a structured database for product visualization. This paper presents a comprehensive
overview of the e-commerce mobile application development process and the technologies
involved.
