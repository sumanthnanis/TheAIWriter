problem statment:
 we are built an e-commerce app for shgs who are trained to make products as they need a platform to sell the products we created an  e-commerce mobile application 

solution: 

First off, Flutter. We went with Flutter because it's like having the best of both worlds. With Flutter, we can build stunning cross-platform mobile applications using a single codebase. That means less time spent on development and more time delivering a polished user experience. Plus, Flutter's hot reload feature is a game-changer. It allows us to make real-time changes to the app and see them instantly, which greatly speeds up our development process.
 Dart is the language that powers Flutter, and it's a perfect fit for our needs. It's a versatile and easy-to-learn language that allows us to write clean and maintainable code for both the frontend and backend components of our app. 
 Node.js. We chose Node.js for our backend because of its scalability and efficiency. Node.js's event-driven architecture makes it perfect for handling I/O-bound operations, such as serving HTTP requests and interacting with databases. And with the vast ecosystem of npm packages available.
